Section: Tweaks
Description: This tweak does exactly what the title says. It lets you change the color of the statusbar to what ever color you want because when using tweaks that change the color of statusbar icons it doesnt always work with a dark background, this tweak will let you use any background you want and still be able to see your colored statusbar icons.
